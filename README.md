## 🔍 About Me 👋🏾
I am an analytical and detail-oriented professional with a strong foundation in data analysis, quality assurance, and technical support, backed by over six years of experience at Apple. My work has centered around troubleshooting complex issues, validating product behavior, creating documentation, and collaborating with engineering teams to identify root causes and improve user experiences.

I am completing my B.S. in Data Analytics with a concentration in Project Management, and I have hands-on experience with SQL, Python, Power BI, JSON validation, defect analysis, and process improvement.
