## Hi there 👋
I am an analytical and detail-oriented professional with a strong foundation in data analysis, quality assurance, and technical support, backed by over six years of experience at Apple. My work has centered around troubleshooting complex issues, validating product behavior, creating documentation, and collaborating with engineering teams to identify root causes and improve user experiences.

I am completing my B.S. in Data Analytics with a concentration in Project Management, and I have hands-on experience with SQL, Python, Power BI, JSON validation, defect analysis, and process improvement. I enjoy solving technical problems, interpreting data to uncover insights, and transforming those insights into clear, actionable recommendations.

I am currently expanding my technical portfolio through guided projects in SQL, Python, and Power BI, along with academic analytics projects. My goal is to transition into a Data Analyst, Technical Analyst, QA Analyst, or Data Quality role where I can combine my technical skills, analytical thinking, and customer-focused mindset to support high-impact initiatives.
